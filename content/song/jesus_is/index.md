As your church we come to you  
Receiving life and strength anew  
Sharing bread and wine  
Till you come back in glory,  
We will proclaim:  

Jesus is  
Always was  
Lord of ages  
Son of God  
Servant-King  
We give our lives  
To love and serve like you  

God almighty  
Glorious counsel  
Creator of all things  
You gave it up for us  

Humble servant  
Man amongst men  
Obedient to the cross  

Jesus is  
Always was  
Lord of ages  
Son of God  
Servant-King  
We give our lives  
To love and serve like you
