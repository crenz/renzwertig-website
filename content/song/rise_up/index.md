Rise up, o people of God  
Take hold of the calling given to you  
Rise up, o people of God  
Walk in his authority  
Rise up, o people of God  
Cling to your King with all of your love  
Rise up, o people of God  
Giving him your everything  

Letting go of all the things that hold you back  
Fix your eyes on Jesus, your King  

We walk in your blessing  
We walk in your power  
We walk in the promises of God  
Proclaiming your kingdom  
Proclaiming your favour  
Proclaiming the glory of our God
