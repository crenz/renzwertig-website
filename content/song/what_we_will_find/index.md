Who knows what we can find  
If we open up our eyes and read the signs  
Still, no matter how hard we try  
There's more to this than meets the eye  

Rolling through life at full bore  
Gotta take some time look out the window  
Make attempts to realize  
The actions that transpire behind the disguise  

I should have known much better than to try and outrun a lie  
It would have been much better just to question why  
I should have known much better than to blindly justify  
Things seem so much clearer seen with open eyes  

Who knows what we will find  
I suspect the search will go on until the end of time  
It's really not about what we want 
But so much more about what we've already got  

I should have known much better than to blindly justify  
Things seem so much clearer seen with open eyes  
It's hard sometimes when every move seems overly scrutinized  
Things appear much clearer with an open mind
