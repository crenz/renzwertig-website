There will come a day  
Every tear is wiped away  
There will come a day  
Where depression turns into joy  
Every sickness will find healing  
And fear will give way to hope  
There will come a day, there will come a day  

There will come a day  
Every slave will be set free  
There will come a day  
Where thereâ€˜s no more poverty  
Where victims will be kings and rulers  
And debt will be dethroned  
There will come a day, there will come a day  

This is our hope, this is our faith  
That Christ will make all things new  
And after death comes life  
This is our hope, this is our faith  
The whole creation will be put to rights  
He will make that day  

And on that very day  
When we finish our race  
On that very day  
We will see him face to face  
God will make his home amongst us  
And his children will be revealed  
We will see that day, we will see that day  

Every prayer, every word, every deed and every song we wrote  
Will find their place in the kingdom of our God  
Our art and our poetry, fellowship and community  
Our labour here will not be in vain  
We will see that day
