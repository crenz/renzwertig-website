There will come a day  
Every tear is wiped away  
There will come a day  
Where depression turns into joy  
Every sickness will find healing  
And fear will give way to hope  
There will come a day  
There will come a day  

There will come a day  
Every slave will be set free  
There will come a day  
Where there‘s no more poverty  
Where victims will be kings and rulers  
And debt will be dethroned  
There will come a day  
There will come a day  

This is our hope, this is our faith  
That Christ will make all things new  
And after death comes life  
This is our hope, this is our faith  
The whole creation will be put to rights  
He will make that day  

And on that very day  
When we finish our race  
On that very day  
We will see him face to face  
God will make his home amongst us  
And his children will be revealed  
We will see that day  
We will see that day  

Every prayer, every word, every deed and every song we wrote  
Will find their place in the kingdom of our God  
Our art and our poetry, fellowship and community  
Our labour here will not be in vain  
We will see that day

### Chinese Translation
有朝一日  

V1  
有朝一日  
泪水轻拂拭去  
欢乐消融抑郁  
伤痛得以疗治  
希望驱逐畏惧  

V2  
有朝一日  
奴隶者脱锁链  
穷困者得丰膳  
牺牲者获尊崇  
欠债者容宽免  

C1  
此吾之所望,此吾之所信  
蒙救主重建庇荫  
笃信者逝而返真  
孕万物各安其位  
圣日依主意而临  

V3  
惟圣日降临  
羔羊停止疾奔  
虔诚直面牧者  
天国始行人间  
神之众子显现  

C2  
祈祷、善言、义举、颂歌  
于天国中各得其所  
艺术、诗歌、友谊、宗社  
付出回报相随相和  
那日,有福者必见得
