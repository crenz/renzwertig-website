You are the God that gives me peace  
Your restoration brings release  
Your presence makes my turmoil cease  
You are there for me  

You are the god that sees me through  
For every need I trust in you  
Faithful provider, God so true  
You are there for me  

_Your presence enfolds me  
Your power astounds me  
Every day, you are there for me  
Your love overwhelms me  
Your grace preserves me  
Every day, you are there for me_

You are the God that leads my way  
Brings guidance through the words you say
You lead me back when far I stray  
You are there for me  

You are the God that makes me right  
You heal the pain, dispel the night  
Your saving grace brings truth and light
You are there for me

_Your presence enfolds me  
Your power astounds me  
Every day, you are there for me  
Your love overwhelms me  
Your grace preserves me  
Every day, you are there for me_  

You are the God that purifies  
Your fire burns through my disguise  
You make me holy in your eyes  
You are there for me  

You are the God that sets me free  
You raise your banner over me  
A standard for the world to see
You are there for me
You are there for me
